# Relative-Word-Pair-Frequency
I created a MapReduce program that calculates the top 100 relative word pair frequencies of words adajacent to each other for the 100kWikiText and the Christmas Carol. 
Suppose A and B are words in a document that appear next to each other. 
Relative word pair freq of A,B= count(A,B)/count(A)
